# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game! This project is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game using React. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the application on your local machine.

## Game Rules

1. The objective of the game is to guess the word letter by letter.
2. You will have a limited number of wrong guesses allowed (10 in this case).
3. Click on the letters to guess them.
4. If you guess a letter correctly, it will be revealed in the word.
5. If you guess a letter incorrectly, a part of the hangman figure will be drawn.
6. You win the game if you guess all the letters in the word before the hangman is completely drawn.
7. You lose the game if the hangman is completely drawn before you guess the word.
8. You can use the "Hint" button to reveal a random letter in the word.
9. If you lose the game, the correct word will be displayed.
